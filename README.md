# SPACEMAN

Spaceman is fun spin on the classic game of Hangman. In my version of Spaceman,
the player is an astronaut in-training going through a mission simulation. In
this sim, the player must find the passcode (a moon orbiting Jupiter) to
activate an emergency protocol that will save their fellow astronaut before they
run out of oxygen.

# Screenshots:

Read the mission memo and press 'Activate' to begin!

Let's zoom in on the control-panel: One of Jupiter's moons has been randomly 
selected as the passcode and your job is to guess which by keying in letters!

The timer color changes to red when there is less than a minute remaining.
